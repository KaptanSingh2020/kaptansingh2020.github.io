Help on QuerySet in module django.db.models.query object:

class QuerySet(builtins.object)
   Represents a lazy database lookup for a set of objects.
 
   Methods defined here:
 
   __and__(self, other)
 
   __bool__(self)
 
   __deepcopy__(self, memo)
       Deep copy of a QuerySet doesn't populate the cache
 
   __getitem__(self, k)
       Retrieves an item or slice from the set of results.
 
   __getstate__(self)
       Allows the QuerySet to be pickled.
 
   __init__(self, model=None, query=None, using=None, hints=None)
       Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 
   __iter__(self)
       The queryset iterator protocol uses three nested iterators in the
       default case:
           1. sql.compiler:execute_sql()
              - Returns 100 rows at time (constants.GET_ITERATOR_CHUNK_SIZE)
                using cursor.fetchmany(). This part is responsible for
                doing some column masking, and returning the rows in chunks.
           2. sql/compiler.results_iter()
              - Returns one row at time. At this point the rows are still just
                tuples. In some cases the return values are converted to
                Python values at this location.
           3. self.iterator()
              - Responsible for turning the rows into model objects.
 
   __len__(self)
 
   __nonzero__(self)
 
   __or__(self, other)
 
   __reduce__(self)
       Used by pickle to deal with the types that we create dynamically when
       specialized queryset such as `ValuesQuerySet` are used in conjunction
       with querysets that are *subclasses* of `QuerySet`.
 
       See `_clone` implementation for more details.
 
   __repr__(self)
       Return repr(self).
 
   __setstate__(self, state)
 
   aggregate(self, *args, **kwargs)
       Returns a dictionary containing the calculations (aggregation)
       over the current queryset
 
       If args is present the expression is passed as a kwarg using
       the Aggregate object's default alias.
 
   all(self)
       Returns a new QuerySet that is a copy of the current one. This allows a
       QuerySet to proxy for a model manager in some cases.
 
   annotate(self, *args, **kwargs)
       Return a query set in which the returned objects have been annotated
       with extra data or aggregations.
 
   bulk_create(self, objs, batch_size=None)
       Inserts each of the instances into the database. This does *not* call
       save() on each of the instances, does not send any pre/post save
       signals, and does not set the primary key attribute if it is an
       autoincrement field.
 
   complex_filter(self, filter_obj)
       Returns a new QuerySet instance with filter_obj added to the filters.
 
       filter_obj can be a Q object (or anything with an add_to_query()
       method) or a dictionary of keyword lookup arguments.
 
       This exists to support framework features such as 'limit_choices_to',
       and usually it will be more natural to use other methods.
 
   count(self)
       Performs a SELECT COUNT() and returns the number of records as an
       integer.
 
       If the QuerySet is already fully cached this simply returns the length
       of the cached results set to avoid multiple SELECT COUNT(*) calls.
 
   create(self, **kwargs)
       Creates a new object with the given kwargs, saving it to the database
       and returning the created object.
 
   dates(self, field_name, kind, order='ASC')
       Returns a list of date objects representing all available dates for
       the given field_name, scoped to 'kind'.
 
   datetimes(self, field_name, kind, order='ASC', tzinfo=None)
       Returns a list of datetime objects representing all available
       datetimes for the given field_name, scoped to 'kind'.
 
   defer(self, *fields)
       Defers the loading of data for certain fields until they are accessed.
       The set of fields to defer is added to any existing set of deferred
       fields. The only exception to this is if None is passed in as the only
       parameter, in which case all deferrals are removed (None acts as a
       reset option).
 
   delete(self)
       Deletes the records in the current QuerySet.
 
   distinct(self, *field_names)
       Returns a new QuerySet instance that will select only distinct results.
 
   earliest(self, field_name=None)
 
   exclude(self, *args, **kwargs)
       Returns a new QuerySet instance with NOT (args) ANDed to the existing
       set.
 
   exists(self)
 
   extra(self, select=None, where=None, params=None, tables=None,
         order_by=None, select_params=None)
       Adds extra SQL fragments to the query.
 
   filter(self, *args, **kwargs)
       Returns a new QuerySet instance with the args ANDed to the existing
       set.
 
   first(self)
       Returns the first object of a query, returns None if no match is found.
 
   get(self, *args, **kwargs)
       Performs the query and returns a single object matching the given
       keyword arguments.
 
   get_or_create(self, defaults=None, **kwargs)
       Looks up an object with the given kwargs, creating one if necessary.
       Returns a tuple of (object, created), where created is a boolean
       specifying whether an object was created.
 
   in_bulk(self, id_list)
       Returns a dictionary mapping each of the given IDs to the object with
       that ID.
 
   is_compatible_query_object_type(self, opts)
 
   iterator(self)
       An iterator over the results from applying this QuerySet to the
       database.
 
   last(self)
       Returns the last object of a query, returns None if no match is found.
 
   latest(self, field_name=None)
 
   none(self)
       Returns an empty QuerySet.
 
   only(self, *fields)
       Essentially, the opposite of defer. Only the fields passed into this
       method and that are not already specified as deferred are loaded
       immediately when the queryset is evaluated.
 
   order_by(self, *field_names)
       Returns a new QuerySet instance with the ordering changed.
 
   prefetch_related(self, *lookups)
       Returns a new QuerySet instance that will prefetch the specified
       Many-To-One and Many-To-Many related objects when the QuerySet is
       evaluated.
 
       When prefetch_related() is called more than once, the list of lookups to
       prefetch is appended to. If prefetch_related(None) is called, the list
       is cleared.
 
   raw(self, raw_query, params=None, translations=None, using=None)
 
   reverse(self)
       Reverses the ordering of the QuerySet.
 
   select_for_update(self, nowait=False)
       Returns a new QuerySet instance that will select objects with a
       FOR UPDATE lock.
 
   select_related(self, *fields)
       Returns a new QuerySet instance that will select related objects.
 
       If fields are specified, they must be ForeignKey fields and only those
       related objects are included in the selection.
 
       If select_related(None) is called, the list is cleared.
 
   update(self, **kwargs)
       Updates all elements in the current QuerySet, setting all the given
       fields to the appropriate values.
 
   update_or_create(self, defaults=None, **kwargs)
       Looks up an object with the given kwargs, updating one with defaults
       if it exists, otherwise creates a new one.
       Returns a tuple (object, created), where created is a boolean
       specifying whether an object was created.
 
   using(self, alias)
       Selects which database this QuerySet should execute its query against.
 
   values(self, *fields)
 
   values_list(self, *fields, **kwargs)

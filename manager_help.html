Help on Manager in module django.db.models.manager object:

class Manager(BaseManagerFromQuerySet)   
Method resolution order:       
Manager
BaseManagerFromQuerySet       
BaseManager       
builtins.object

  Methods inherited from BaseManagerFromQuerySet:

  aggregate(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a dictionary containing the
      calculations (aggregation) over the current queryset

      If args is present the expression is passed as a kwarg using the 
      Aggregate object's default alias.

  annotate(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Return a query set in which the returned
      objects have been annotated with extra data or aggregations.

  bulk_create(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Inserts each of the instances into the
      database. This does *not* call save() on each of the instances, 
      does not send any pre/post save signals, and does not set the primary key
      attribute if it is an autoincrement field.

  complex_filter(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a new QuerySet instance with
      filter_obj added to the filters.

      filter_obj can be a Q object (or anything with an add_to_query() method)
      or a dictionary of keyword lookup arguments.

      This exists to support framework features such as 'limit_choices_to', and
      usually it will be more natural to use other methods.

  count(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Performs a SELECT COUNT() and returns the number of records as an integer.

      If the QuerySet is already fully cached this simply returns the length of
      the cached results set to avoid multiple SELECT COUNT(*) calls.

  create(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Creates a new object with the given kwargs, saving it to the database and 
      returning the created object.

  dates(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a list of date objects representing all available dates for 
      the given field_name, scoped to 'kind'.

  datetimes(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a list of datetime objects representing all available datetimes 
      for the given field_name, scoped to 'kind'.

  defer(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Defers the loading of data for certain fields until they are accessed. 
      The set of fields to defer is added to any existing set of deferred 
      fields. The only exception to this is if None is passed in as the only
      parameter, in which case all deferrals are removed (None acts as a reset 
      option).

  distinct(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a new QuerySet instance that will select only distinct results.

  earliest(self, *args, **kwargs)

  exclude(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a new QuerySet instance with NOT (args) ANDed to the existing set.

  exists(self, *args, **kwargs)

  extra(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Adds extra SQL fragments to the query.

  filter(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a new QuerySet instance with the args ANDed to the existing set.

  first(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns the first object of a query, returns None if no match is found.

  get(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Performs the query and returns a single object matching the given 
      keyword arguments.

  get_or_create(self, *args, **kwargs) 
  Looks up an object with the given kwargs, creating one if necessary. Returns 
  a tuple of (object, created), where created is a boolean specifying whether 
  an object was created.

  in_bulk(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a dictionary mapping each of the given IDs to the object with 
      that ID.

  iterator(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      An iterator over the results from applying this QuerySet to the database.

  last(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns the last object of a query, returns None if no match is found.

  latest(self, *args, **kwargs)

  none(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns an empty QuerySet.

  only(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Essentially, the opposite of defer. Only the fields passed into this 
      method and that are not already specified as deferred are loaded 
      immediately when the queryset is evaluated.

  order_by(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a new QuerySet instance with the ordering changed.

  prefetch_related(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a new QuerySet instance that will prefetch the specified 
      Many-To-One and Many-To-Many related objects when the QuerySet is 
      evaluated.

      When prefetch_related() is called more than once, the list of lookups to
      prefetch is appended to. If prefetch_related(None) is called, the list is
      cleared.

  raw(self, *args, **kwargs)

  reverse(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Reverses the ordering of the QuerySet.

  select_for_update(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a new QuerySet instance that will select objects with a 
      FOR UPDATE lock.

  select_related(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Returns a new QuerySet instance that will select related objects.

      If fields are specified, they must be ForeignKey fields and only those
      related objects are included in the selection.

      If select_related(None) is called, the list is cleared.

  update(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Updates all elements in the current QuerySet, setting all the given 
      fields to the appropriate values.

  update_or_create(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Looks up an object with the given kwargs, updating one with defaults if 
      it exists, otherwise creates a new one.
      Returns a tuple (object, created), where created is a boolean specifying
      whether an object was created.

  using(self, *args, **kwargs) 
      Selects which database this QuerySet should execute its query against.

  values(self, *args, **kwargs)

  values_list(self, *args, **kwargs)

  __eq__(self, other)       
      Return self==value.

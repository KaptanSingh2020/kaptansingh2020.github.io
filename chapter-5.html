<h2 class="second-heading">URLconf</h2>
<p>
    To design URLs for an app, you create a Python module informally called a URLconf (URL configuration). This module is pure Python code and is a mapping between URL path expressions to Python functions (your views).<br>
    This mapping can be as short or as long as needed. It can reference other mappings. And, because it’s pure Python code, it can be constructed dynamically. <br>
    Here is an example:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
from django.urls import include, path, re_path
# Older versions used the following line:
# from django.conf.urls import include, url
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]

</code></pre>
<p>
    The include() function allows referencing other URLconfs. Whenever Django encounters include(), it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.<br>
    You should always use include() when you include other URL patterns. admin.site.urls is the only exception to this. <br>
    Here is another example:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('articles/2003/', views.special_case_2003),
    path('articles/< int:year>/', views.year_archive),
    path('articles/< int:year>/< int:month>/', views.month_archive),
    path('articles/< int:year>/< int:month>/< slug:slug>/', 
          views.article_detail),
]

</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/urls/">This </a>is a link to the official documentaion.</p>
<h2 class="second-heading">View</h2>
<p>
    A view function, or view for short, is simply a Python function that takes an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response. This response can be the HTML contents of a Web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image . . . or anything, really. The view itself contains whatever arbitrary logic is necessary to return that response. This code can live anywhere you want, as long as it’s on your Python path. There’s no other requirement–no “magic,” so to speak. For the sake of putting the code somewhere, the convention is to put views in a file called views.py, placed in your project or application directory.
</p>
<h2 class="second-heading">HttpRequest object</h2>
<p>
    An HttpRequest object contains all of the information about the page requested, any data the user is passing to the website, and any data the browser is sending about the user. It has many attributes and methods. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest">This </a>is a link to the documentation.</p>
<h2 class="second-heading">HttpResponse object</h2>
<p>
    In contrast to HttpRequest objects, which are created automatically by Django, HttpResponse objects are your responsibility. Each view you write is responsible for instantiating, populating, and returning an HttpResponse.
    The HttpResponse class lives in the django.http module. Typical usage is to pass the contents of the page, as a string, to the HttpResponse constructor. But if you want to add content incrementally, you can use response as a file-like object. Finally, you can pass HttpResponse an iterator rather than strings. HttpResponse will consume the iterator immediately, store its content as a string, and discard it. Objects with a close() method such as files and generators are immediately closed.

    If you need the response to be streamed from the iterator to the client, you must use the StreamingHttpResponse class instead.
</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponse">This </a>is a link to the documentation.</p>
<h2 class="second-heading">Http404</h2>
<p>
    For convenience, and because it’s a good idea to have a consistent 404 error page across your site, Django provides an Http404 exception. If you raise Http404 at any point in a view function, Django will catch it and return the standard error page for your application, along with an HTTP error code 404. <br>
    Here is an example:
</p>       
<pre><code class="language-python">
from django.http import Http404
from django.shortcuts import render
from polls.models import Poll

def detail(request, poll_id):
    try:
        p = Poll.objects.get(pk=poll_id)
    except Poll.DoesNotExist:
        raise Http404("Poll does not exist")
    return render(request, 'polls/detail.html', {'poll': p})

FUNCTIONS

def get_list_or_404(klass, *args, **kwargs):
        Uses filter() to return a list of objects, or raise a Http404 
        exception if the list is empty.

        klass may be a Model, Manager, or QuerySet object. All other passed
        arguments and keyword arguments are used in the filter() query.

def get_object_or_404(klass, *args, **kwargs):
        Uses get() to return an object, or raises a Http404 exception if 
        the object does not exist.

        klass may be a Model, Manager, or QuerySet object. All other passed
        arguments and keyword arguments are used in the get() query.

        Note: Like with get(), an MultipleObjectsReturned will be raised if
        more than one object is found.

def redirect(to, *args, **kwargs):
        Returns an HttpResponseRedirect to the appropriate URL for the 
        arguments passed.

        The arguments could be:
        * A model: the model s get_absolute_url() method will be called.
        * A view name, possibly with arguments: urlresolvers.reverse() 
          will be used to reverse-resolve the name.
        * A URL, which will be used as-is for the redirect location.

        By default issues a temporary redirect; pass permanent=True to 
        issue a permanent redirect

def render(request, template_name, context=None, 
           context_instance=< object at 0>, content_type=None, status=None, 
           current_app=< object at 0>, dirs=< object 0>, 
           dictionary=< object at 0>, using=None):
        Returns a HttpResponse whose content is filled with the result of 
        calling template.loader.render_to_string() with the passed arguments.
        Uses a RequestContext by default.

def render_to_response(template_name, context=None, 
                       context_instance=< object at 0>, content_type=None, 
                       status=None, dirs=< object at 0>, 
                       dictionary=< object at 0>, using=None):
        Returns a HttpResponse whose content is filled with the result of 
        calling django.template.loader.render_to_string() with the passed 
        arguments.

def resolve_url(to, *args, **kwargs):
        Return a URL appropriate for the arguments passed.

        The arguments could be:
        * A model: the model s get_absolute_url() function will be called.
        * A view name, possibly with arguments: urlresolvers.reverse() will
          be used to reverse-resolve the name.
        * A URL, which will be returned as-is.

<h2 class="second-heading">Class-based Views</h2>
<p>
    Class-based views provide an alternative way to implement views as Python objects instead of functions. They do not replace function-based views, but have certain differences and advantages when compared to function-based views. <br>
    At its core, a class-based view allows you to respond to different HTTP request methods with different class instance methods, instead of with conditionally branching code inside a single view function. <br>

    So where the code to handle HTTP GET in a view function would look something like:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
from django.http import HttpResponse

def my_view(request):
    if request.method == 'GET':
        # <view logic>
        return HttpResponse('result')

</code></pre>
<p>
    In a class-based view, this would become:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views import View

class MyView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        # <view logic>
        return HttpResponse('result')

</code></pre>
<p>
    Because Django’s URL resolver expects to send the request and associated arguments to a callable function, not a class, class-based views have an as_view() class method which returns a function that can be called when a request arrives for a URL matching the associated pattern. The function creates an instance of the class and calls its dispatch() method. dispatch looks at the request to determine whether it is a GET, POST, etc, and relays the request to a matching method if one is defined, or raises HttpResponseNotAllowed if not:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
from django.urls import path
from myapp.views import MyView

urlpatterns = [
    path('about/', MyView.as_view()),
]

</code></pre>
<p>
    It is worth noting that what your method returns is identical to what you return from a function-based view, namely some form of HttpResponse. This means that http shortcuts or TemplateResponse objects are valid to use inside a class-based view. <br>

    While a minimal class-based view does not require any class attributes to perform its job, class attributes are useful in many class-based designs, and there are two ways to configure or set class attributes. <br>

    The first is the standard Python way of subclassing and overriding attributes and methods in the subclass. So that if your parent class had an attribute greeting like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views import View

class GreetingView(View):
    greeting = "Good Day"

    def get(self, request):
        return HttpResponse(self.greeting)
    
</code></pre>
<p>
    You can override that in a subclass:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
class MorningGreetingView(GreetingView):
    greeting = "Morning to ya"

</code></pre>
<p>
    Another option is to configure class attributes as keyword arguments to the as_view() call in the URLconf:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
urlpatterns = [
    path('about/', GreetingView.as_view(greeting="G'day")),
]

</code></pre>
<h3 class="third-heading">Decorating Class-based Views</h3>
<p>
    The simplest way of decorating class-based views is to decorate the result of the as_view() method. The easiest place to do this is in the URLconf where you deploy your view:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, permission_required
from django.views.generic import TemplateView

from .views import VoteView

urlpatterns = [
    path('about/', 
          login_required(TemplateView.as_view(template_name="secret.html"))),
    path('vote/', permission_required('polls.can_vote')(VoteView.as_view())),
]

</code></pre>
<p>
    This approach applies the decorator on a per-instance basis. If you want every instance of a view to be decorated, you need to take a different approach. <br>
    To decorate every instance of a class-based view, you need to decorate the class definition itself. To do this you apply the decorator to the dispatch() method of the class. <br>

    A method on a class isn’t quite the same as a standalone function, so you can’t just apply a function decorator to the method – you need to transform it into a method decorator first. The method_decorator decorator transforms a function decorator into a method decorator so that it can be used on an instance method. For example:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator
from django.views.generic import TemplateView

class ProtectedView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'secret.html'

    @method_decorator(login_required)
    def dispatch(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return super().dispatch(*args, **kwargs)

</code></pre>
<p>
    Or, more succinctly, you can decorate the class instead and pass the name of the method to be decorated as the keyword argument name:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
@method_decorator(login_required, name='dispatch')
class ProtectedView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'secret.html'

</code></pre>
<p>
    If you have a set of common decorators used in several places, you can define a list or tuple of decorators and use this instead of invoking method_decorator() multiple times. These two classes are equivalent:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
decorators = [never_cache, login_required]

@method_decorator(decorators, name='dispatch')
class ProtectedView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'secret.html'

@method_decorator(never_cache, name='dispatch')
@method_decorator(login_required, name='dispatch')
class ProtectedView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'secret.html'

</code></pre>
